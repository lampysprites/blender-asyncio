# Blender asyncio demo
A simple demonstration of using asyncio with blender operators using `async def`/`await` syntax - no advanced async or networking.
In Blender, example operators appear in the tab of the 3D viewport sidebar (Toggle with `N` key)

## Acknowledgements
Async handling is taken from [Blender Cloud Addon](https://cloud.blender.org/services) with insignificant changes
